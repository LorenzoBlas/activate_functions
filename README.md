# Activation Functions for Neural Networks

This repository provides implementations and visualizations of commonly used activation functions in neural networks. These functions are essential in deep learning as they introduce non-linearity to the model and help it learn complex patterns.

## Overview

Activation functions are a crucial component of neural networks, determining how neurons in a layer activate based on input. This project includes the following activation functions:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs the input if positive; otherwise, outputs zero.
- **Sigmoid**: Maps input values to a range between 0 and 1, often used in binary classification.
- **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: Maps input values to a range between -1 and 1, symmetric around zero.
- **Leaky ReLU**: A variant of ReLU that allows small gradients for negative inputs.

These functions are implemented in Python and visualized using Matplotlib.

---

## Features

- Implementations of common activation functions.
- Visualizations of activation functions to understand their behavior.
- Easy-to-use modular structure.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LorenzoBlas/activate_functions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd activate_functions
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

To visualize the activation functions, run the `main.py` script:

```
python main.py
```

This will display plots of each activation function one by one.
